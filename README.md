# Investments

Some tools I've been developing to help me track my investments

# Features: 
	- Extracts data from Bitcoins, B3 assets (stocks, ETFs, BDRs, FIIs), Investment Funds not listed in B3 and Fundamentus.com.br data
	- Extracts portfolio details from CEI 
	- Keeps historical data organized in separate files / folders 
	- Daily Reports (pandas / Dash report) 
	- ML Models to analyze the portfolio and recommend new assets to invest

# To Do List 
	- Upload / Download the historical data from Google Drive 
	- Build Dash Report 
	- Automate Extracting / Analysis processes
	
### Disclaimer 
This code was developed to my personal use.

__ I'm keeping the ML models and more advanced analysis on a private repo. I'm yet to decide if I'm going to open source them. Feel free to 
contact me if you wish to know more about them__
