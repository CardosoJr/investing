       " 'Ryan Cohen Gives Shoutout to Reddit Crowd at Annual Meeting (1)\\nWednesday, June 9, 2021 05:41 PM \\nBy Olga Kharif\\n\\nCohen was elected the retailer‚Äôs chairman at the meeting\\nCohen said he doesn‚Äôt plan to telegraph his strategy to rivals\\n(Bloomberg) --Ryan Cohen, the GameStop Corp. activist investor who became its chairman on Wednesday, said he isn‚Äôt going to unveil a new strategy yet. But he gave some hints during a talk at the retailer‚Äôs annual meeting.\\n‚ÄúWe are trying to do something that nobody in the retail space has ever done,‚Äù Cohen said at the gathering, held in GameStop‚Äôs hometown of Grapevine, Texas. ‚ÄúBut we believe we‚Äôre putting the right pieces in place and we have clear goals: delighting customers and driving shareholder value for the long term.‚Äù\\n\\nCohen is trying to turn the brick-and-mortar retailer into an e-commerce competitor to Amazon.com Inc., in part by increasing the number of products and services it offers. He‚Äôs already shaken up the company‚Äôs management team, and is working to improve customer service and delivery. GameStop, slated to release its quarterly results later on Wednesday, is currently seeking a new chief executive officer.\\n\\nThe company is still struggling, but it has won the faith of the Reddit crowd, which has helped propel the stock more than 1,500% in 2021. GameStop has been one of this year‚Äôs top meme stocks, which trade off of social-media buzz rather than business fundamentals. The shares gained as much as 6.7% to $320 on Wednesday.\\n\\nWhile some investors had hoped Cohen would lay out a detailed plan for turning GameStop around, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not going to happen,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt find us talking a big game, making a bunch of lofty promises or telegraphing our strategy to the competition.‚Äù\\n\\nHis previous company, pet supplier Chewy, had the same philosophy, he said.\\n\\nCohen announced a stake in GameStop last year and began pushing for changes at the video-game retailer. He now owns 13% of the company and has three seats on its board. On Wednesday, Cohen also made a shoutout to the Reddit fans behind GameStop‚Äôs rally.\\n\\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre fortunate to have such a special group of investors holding the company‚Äôs shares,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou guys inspire us to think bigger, fight harder and work longer each day.‚Äù',\n",
